# smallbizsociety.

## Description

More than a handful of the local businesses in my neighborhood have gone out of business due to the impact of COVID-19 so I wanted to create something similar to Yelp but more niche for all small businesses in New York City. This app was created to serve as a platform that will allow a small business to add their business and start posting their products right away! The small business has the ability to create, edit, update, and delete their business as well as their items.

smallbizsociety was created using a [Ruby on Rails API](https://github.com/lisellelogan/small-biz-society-backend) for the backend and a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the forntend.
